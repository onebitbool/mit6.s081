Q: Explain the output of vmprint in terms of Fig 3-4 from the text. What does page 0 contain? What is in page 2? When running in user mode, could the process read/write the memory mapped by page 1?

A: page 0 contains text and data of process; page 2 contains stack of process; page 1 is guard page, so process cannot read/write the page when running in user mode.

Q: Explain why the third test srcva + len < srcva is necessary in copyin_new(): give values for srcva and len for which the first two test fail (i.e., they will not cause to return -1) but for which the third one is true (resulting in returning -1). 

A: the test is for check overflow when srcva + len; example: srcva = 0xff, len = 0xffffffff.
